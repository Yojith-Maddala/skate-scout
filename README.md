## 🚀 Inspiration
For a long time, students have been trying to perfect **TAMU Bus Routes**, a platform providing real-time bus information.  
Yet, it felt strange and counterintuitive that **no such system existed for micromobility** — even though **Texas A&M has one of the largest campuses in the United States**.  

As micromobility became more common with **bikes, scooters, and skateboards**, new challenges emerged:
- Rough TAMU roads  
- Safety concerns and near misses  
- Crowded sidewalks  
- Elevation and terrain variations  

We built **Skate Scout** to solve these problems — combining technology, community feedback, and real-world testing to make campus travel smoother and safer.

## 🧠 The Learning Process
Throughout the development of **Skate Scout**, our team learned to bridge **engineering and empathy** — turning raw data into meaningful experiences.  

### Key Steps:
- **Problem Identification:** Campus congestion and micromobility inefficiency.  
- **User Research:** Conducted informal surveys among Aggie students to understand common routes, hazards, and needs.  
- **Data Modeling:** Modeled the Texas A&M campus as a **weighted graph**, with dynamic edge penalties for rough terrain, hills, and congestion.  
- **Frontend Development:** Applied UI/UX principles to create a clean, Aggie-themed interface optimized for readability and accessibility.  
- **Smoothness Score Algorithm:** Used real-time and crowdsourced reports to generate a “Smoothness Score” for route recommendations.  
- **Contextual Data:** Integrated data points such as **bike racks** and **construction zones** to improve route accuracy.  
- **Model Testing:** Validated routes through **real skate sessions**, refining weight calibrations and optimizing comfort vs. speed.

## 🏗️ The Building Process
We adopted a **modular development strategy** to enable scalable feature additions and parallel collaboration.

### Workflow:
- Split the project into feature modules, assigning clear responsibilities to each team member.  
- Used **GitHub** for version control, allowing easy collaboration, change tracking, and rollback capabilities.  
- Conducted **peer testing** to ensure code quality and eliminate bugs early.  
- Prioritized clear communication during integration and deployment phases.  

This modular, iterative structure allowed us to build quickly, debug efficiently, and deliver a cohesive product.

## ⚙️ Challenges We Faced
Every challenge became a stepping stone:
- 🔍 **Finding free, reliable APIs:** Required extensive research and creative data sourcing.  
- ⚖️ **Conflicting design ideas:** Taught us to balance perspectives and focus on user benefit.  
- 💻 **Limited HTML/JavaScript experience:** Pushed us to self-learn through documentation, trial, and collaboration.
